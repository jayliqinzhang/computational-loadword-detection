This code repository implement the method of computational loanword detection using the sound distance. The result of the paper shows that the sound distances generated by the sound-class-alignment (SCA) based method ([List, 2012](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/874d/14f33aea18bcba36328d10287a8b55070c40.pdf)) is the most superior among the evaluated sound distance measurement method. The data used in this experiment is from [Mennecier et al.(2016)](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-00601015), the pronunciations of the words in the Turkic and Indo-Iranian language family representing concepts from the Swadesh list. 


# Data 

The [mydata.xls](https://github.com/jayliqinzhang/computational-loanword-detection/blob/master/data/mydata.xls) is a re-formating of the data from Mennecier et al. (2016). There are three rows in the data, which are concepts, pronunciations (in ipa) of the concepts in Turkic, and pronunciations (in ipa) of the concepts in Indo-Iranian. In each cell, it contains a list of pronunciations which are the records of all the interviewees making the sounds. In the columns are the concepts which are shown to the interviewees.     


## Distance data

The plk data files include the distance values generated by **PMI method** ([Wieling et al., 2009](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1642053)), **spectrogram method** ([Heeringa, 2004](https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/9800656/thesis.pdf)) , and the **SCA method** ([List, 2012](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/874d/14f33aea18bcba36328d10287a8b55070c40.pdf)) respectively. They are in pickle formats which can be extract by using the function: 

```
pickle.load()
```

the data is in the format as following: 

```
(concept, distance, ipa_in_turkic, ipa_in_indoiranian)
```

for instance, 

```
('one', 0.84, 'bÉªr', 'jak')
```

## Cognate data

The [cognate_list.pickle](https://github.com/jayliqinzhang/computational-loanword-detection/blob/master/data/cognate_list.pickle) is the data containing the gold standard of cognate. It is a list of tuples and each tuple contains a pair of pronunciations (represented by IPA). Each pair in the list is identified as cognate by the expert. It is used for the evaluation of the performance of the model to automatically detect the loanwords. 


# SCA Sound distance

Running the [sca_distance.py](https://github.com/jayliqinzhang/computational-loanword-detection/blob/master/sca_distance.py) output the sound distance generated from the SCA-based method. The result is [sca_distance.pkl](https://github.com/jayliqinzhang/computational-loanword-detection/blob/master/data/sca_distance.pkl). 


# PMI sound distance 

[Lo4](http://www.let.rug.nl/kleiweg/L04/) is a software for dialectometrics and cartography. It provides [methods](http://www.let.rug.nl/kleiweg/L04/Manuals/leven.html) to generate the PMI-based operation cost for the calculation of the Levenshtein distance. 


# Threshold

A threshold has to be defined in order to separate loanwords and non-loanwords. Running [threshold.py](https://github.com/jayliqinzhang/computational-loanword-detection/blob/master/threshold.py) with the input of sound distance values will output the best threshold, the threshold leading to the highest f1 score. A plot can be generated to show how the performance measurements change along with different threshold values.
