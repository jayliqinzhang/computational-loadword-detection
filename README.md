This code repository implement the method of computational loanword detection using the sound distance. The result of the paper shows that the sound distances generated by the sound-class-alignment (SCA) based method (List, 2012) is the most superior among the evaluated sound distance measurement method. The data used in this experiment is from Mennecier et al.(2016).  


# Data 

The data file includes the distance values generated by PMI method, spectrogram method, and the SCA method. They are in pickle formats which can be extract by using the command

pickle.load()

The cognate_list.pickle is the data containing the gold standard of cognate. It is a list of tuples and each tuple contains a pair of pronunciations (represented by IPA). Each pair in the list is identified as cognate by the expert. It is used for the evaluation of the performance of the model to automatically detect the loanwords. 








# Sound distance

Running the sca_distance.py output the sound distance generated from the SCA-based method. The data is in the format as shown in the excel file "mydata.xls". The output of sca_distance.py is the pickle file containing the a list of tuples representing: 

(concept, distance, ipa_in_turkic, ipa_in_indoiranian)

for instance, 

('one', 0.84, 'bÉªr', 'jak')

It will be used for further loanword detection in the next step. 

On the other hand, you can use your own data in the format as in the excel file to generate a tuple list.
